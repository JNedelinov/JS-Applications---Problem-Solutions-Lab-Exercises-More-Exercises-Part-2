These are my exam prep solutions from past JavaScript Applications courses at SoftUni.

# THIS IS PART 2

What's included in the 2nd Part:
  1. Exam Prep #1 - SoftWiki;
  2. Exam Prep #2 - MyBlog;
  3. Exam Prep #3 - UniEnt.
  
Some of the solutions are simpler than others. 
You might notice that I have used different techniques for some exercises, just because I wanted to experiment with which style might work the best for me.

I hope I could help students from the same learning path in SoftUni as me.
